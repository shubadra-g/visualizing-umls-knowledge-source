A Data Vis Project

Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) has many Knowledge Sources, one of which is the Metathesaurus. 
Metathesaurus has 'concepts', medical terms which have atoms and relations to other concepts (known as concept relations). 

This project visualizes the links between various concepts. The baseline visual browser was developed between October - December 2018 by Rohit Vibhu, Kushagradhi Bhowmik and Shubadra Govindan.
