# Visualizing UMLS Metathesaurus - A Data Vis Project


Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) has many Knowledge Sources, one of which is the Metathesaurus. 
Metathesaurus has 'concepts', medical terms which have atoms and relations to other concepts (known as concept relations). 

This project visualizes the relationships between different concepts. The baseline visual browser was developed between October - December 2018 by Rohit Vibhu, Kushagradhi Bhowmik and Shubadra Govindan as a part of CS 594 - Visual Data Science. 

This is my Masters project at UIC. My advisor is Dr. G. Elisabeta Marai from the Department of Computer Science.
