This prevents the inward current flow of positively charged potassium (K+) ions into the cell, and induces a calcium ion (Ca2+) influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, which triggers exocytosis of insulin-containing granules. In addition, glyburide also inhibits the SUR1-regulated nonselective cation (NC) Ca-ATP channel, melastatin 4 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4; (TRPM4)), thereby preventing capillary failure and brain swelling. SUR1-TRPM4 channels are formed by co-assembly of SUR1 with TRPM4 in neurons, astrocytes, and capillary endothelium during cerebral ischemia.

Seizure: a paroxysmal transient disturbance of brain function that may be manifested as episodic impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor phenomena, psychic or sensory disturbance or perturbation of the autonomic brain electrical activity.	WHY:	Seizures may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus or in necrotizing vasculitides such as polyarteritis, eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis, aortic arch arteritis, or rheumatoid arteritis.	HOW:	A seizure probably exists when there are generalized convulsions or focal motor/sensory phenomenon. GENERALIZED CONVULSIONS may be preceded by an aura but usually have a sudden loss of consciousness with generalized muscle rigidity then generalized muscle activity. They may have incontinence of urine or feces or laceration of the tongue or buccal mucosa. This usually is followed by flaccidity, drowsiness, or complaints of a headache or sore muscles. FOCAL MOTOR/SENSORY PHENOMENON may precede generalized convulsions but may be tonic or clonic muscle activity that is limited to one extremity, one side of the body, or one side of the face or lateralized/localized sensory sensations. These may only be brief sudden involuntary muscle contractions associated with transitory loss of muscle tone and a brief loss of contact with the environment, repetitive automatic behavior patterns, feelings of familiarity or unfamiliarity associated with compulsive thinking, unpleasant epi- gastric sensations that may radiate to the head, or hallucinations of an auditory, vertiginous, olfactory, gustatory, or visual type.

Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into Th2 cells, a process that is promoted by interleukin 4 (IL-4). Activated Th2 cells stimulate B cells to produce IgE antibodies in response to IL-4 and IL-13. IgE binds the high affinity IgE receptor at the surface of mast cells, the proliferation and differentiation of which is promoted by IL-9.The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Activated mast cells and Th2 cells also induce the production of IL-5. IL-5 travels to the bone marrow and regulates the differentiation and egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the blood. Moreover activated mast cells and Th2 cells in the lung generate the cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. These cytokines stimulate the generation of eotaxin by lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells.

Seizure: a paroxysmal transient disturbance of brain function that may be manifested as episodic impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor phenomena, psychic or sensory disturbance or perturbation of the autonomic brain electrical activity.	WHY:	Seizures may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus or in necrotizing vasculitides such as polyarteritis, eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis, aortic arch arteritis, or rheumatoid arteritis.	HOW:	A seizure probably exists when there are generalized convulsions or focal motor/sensory phenomenon. GENERALIZED CONVULSIONS may be preceded by an aura but usually have a sudden loss of consciousness with generalized muscle rigidity then generalized muscle activity. They may have incontinence of urine or feces or laceration of the tongue or buccal mucosa. This usually is followed by flaccidity, drowsiness, or complaints of a headache or sore muscles. FOCAL MOTOR/SENSORY PHENOMENON may precede generalized convulsions but may be tonic or clonic muscle activity that is limited to one extremity, one side of the body, or one side of the face or lateralized/localized sensory sensations. These may only be brief sudden involuntary muscle contractions associated with transitory loss of muscle tone and a brief loss of contact with the environment, repetitive automatic behavior patterns, feelings of familiarity or unfamiliarity associated with compulsive thinking, unpleasant epi- gastric sensations that may radiate to the head, or hallucinations of an auditory, vertiginous, olfactory, gustatory, or visual type.

HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, full-length mHtt can interfere with BDNF vesicular transport on microtubules. This mutant protein also may lead to abnormal endocytosis and secretion in neurons, because normal Htt form a complex with the proteins Hip1, clathrin and AP2 that are involved in endocytosis. In addition, mHtt affects Ca2+ signaling by sensitizing InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3, stimulating NR2B/NR1 NMDAR activity, and destabilizing mitochondrial Ca2+ handling. As a result, stimulation of glutamate receptors leads to supranormal Ca2+ responses in HD MSN and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. The mHtt translocates to the nucleus, where it forms intranuclear inclusions, though they are not primarily responsible for toxicity. Nuclear toxicity is believed to be caused by interference with gene transcription, leading to loss of transcription of neuroprotective molecules such as BDNF.

C1521999,A7654071,AT224187166,,NCI_BioC,"Myocardial infraction (MI) is the condition of irreversible necrosis of the heart muscle that results from prolonged ischemia. Nearly 1.5 million people in US sustain an MI each year, and this event proves fatal in approximately one third of patients. Approximately 90% of MI results from formation of an acute thrombus that obstructs an atherosclerotic coronary artery. The thrombus transforms a region of plaque narrowing to one of complete vessel occlusion. The responsible thrombus appears to be generated by interactions between the atherosclerotic plaque, the coronary endothelium, circulating platelets, and dynamic vasomotor tone of the vessel wall, all of which overwhelm natural protective mechanisms. The endogenous protective mechanisms against thrombosis include: 1) Inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III (ATIII), the effectiveness of which is enhanced by binding of ATIII to heparin sulfate. The antithrombin binding region of commercial heparin consists of sulfated disaccharide units; 2) Inactivation of clotting factors Va and VIIIa by activated protein C (protein C*), an action that is enhanced by protein S. Protein C is activated by the thrombomodulin (TM)-thrombin complex; 3) Inactivation of factor VII/tissue factor complex by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Coumarin drugs (Warfarin) blocks the g-carboxylation of Glu residues in prothrombin and factors VII, IX and X which results in incomplete molecules that are biologically inactive in coagulation (left panel); 4) Lysis of fibrin clots by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA); 5) Inhibition of platelet activation by prostacyclin and EDRF-NO. Platelets adhere to exposed collagen and are activated at the site of endothelial damage in the blood vessel. Activated platelets release adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serotonin (5-HT), and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which activate additional platelets. Binding of thrombin further activates the platelets. Three adjoining platelets are shown in the process of viscous metamorphosis (top right). Increased cellular Ca2+ facilitates binding of fibrinogen. If the intraluminal thrombus at the site of plaque disruption totally occludes the vessel, blood flow beyond the obstruction will cease, prolonged ischemia will occur and MI (usually Q-wave MI) will likely result.

Raynaud's Phenomenon: the paroxysmal constriction of the small arteries and arterioles of the hands or feet, usually precipitated by cold or emotional upset, resulting in pallor and cyanosis of the fingers or toes following a characteristic pattern.	WHY:	Raynaud's phenomenon may occur in mixed connective tissue disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis, poly- myositis/dermatomyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis associated with Sjogren's syndrome.	HOW:	In Raynaud's phenomenon there are three classic color changes of the fingers or toes. First, vasoconstriction results in a white blanching of the fingertips. Second, vasodilatation with sludging of vascular flow follows and results in blue, cyanotic digits. Finally, with recovery, there is increased blood flow with resulting erythema of the fingers. With observation of two of the three color changes, Raynaud's phenomenon is considered present. Local body cooling (by placing the hands in ice cold water) may demonstrate Raynaud's phenomenon, but some cases require general body cooling before the characteristic color phases occur. Permanent tissue damage can be induced by this testing, which therefore must be done only when absolutely necessary. If the digits show persistent cyanosis or there is evidence of pre-existing necrosis, performing this test is especially hazardous. One or more digits may be involved in Raynaud's phenomenon, and this involvement may be unilateral.	REFS:	1) Spittell, JA: ""Raynaud's phenomenon and allied vasospastic disorders"".

The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms.

The 2 major pathways of apoptosis are the extrinsic (Fas and other TNFR superfamily members and ligands) and the intrinsic (mitochondria-associated) pathways, both of which are found in the cytoplasm. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by death receptor engagement, which initiates a signaling cascade mediated by caspase-8 activation. Caspase-8 both feeds directly into caspase-3 activation and stimulates the release of cytochrome c by the mitochondria. Caspase-3 activation leads to the degradation of cellular proteins necessary to maintain cell survival and integrity. The intrinsic pathway occurs when various apoptotic stimuli trigger the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (independently of caspase-8 activation). Cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to promote the activation of caspase-3. Recent studies point to the ER as a third subcellular compartment implicated in apoptotic execution. Alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis and accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER cause ER stress. Prolonged ER stress can result in the activation of BAD and/or caspase-12, and execute apoptosis.",N,

IgE binds the high affinity IgE receptor at the surface of mast cells, the proliferation and differentiation of which is promoted by IL-9.The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Activated mast cells and Th2 cells also induce the production of IL-5. IL-5 travels to the bone marrow and regulates the differentiation and egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the blood. Moreover activated mast cells and Th2 cells in the lung generate the cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. These cytokines stimulate the generation of eotaxin by lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Eotaxin then stimulates the selective recruitment of eosinophils from the airway microvessels into the lung tissue.

Along with the <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/adenoids.html'>adenoids</a>, tonsils are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. Tonsils and adenoids work by trapping the germs coming in through the mouth and nose.</p> <h3>What is tonsillitis?</h3> <p>Tonsillitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the tonsils. Sometimes along with tonsillitis, the adenoids are also swollen.</p> <h3>What causes tonsillitis?</h3> <p>The cause of tonsillitis is usually a viral infection. Bacterial infections such as <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/streptococcalinfections.html'>strep throat</a> can also cause tonsillitis.</p> <h3>Who gets tonsillitis?</h3> <p>Tonsillitis is most common in children over age two. Almost every child in the United States gets it at least once. Tonsillitis caused by bacteria is more common in kids ages 5-15. Tonsillitis caused by a virus is more common in younger children.</p> <p>Adults can get tonsillitis, but it is not very common.</p> <h3>Is tonsillitis contagious?</h3> <p>Although tonsillitis is not contagious, the viruses and bacteria that cause it are contagious. <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/germsandhygiene.html'>Frequent handwashing</a> can help prevent spreading or catching the infections.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of tonsillitis?</h3> <p>The symptoms of tonsillitis include</p> <ul> <li>A <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/sorethroat.html'>sore throat</a>, which may be severe</li> <li>Red, swollen tonsils</li> <li>Trouble swallowing</li> <li>A white or yellow coating on the tonsils</li> <li>Swollen glands in the neck</li> <li>Fever</li> <li>Bad breath</li> </ul> <h3>When should I get medical help for my child?</h3> <p>You should call your health care provider if your child</p> <ul> <li>Has a sore throat for more than two days</li> <li>Has trouble or pain when swallowing</li> <li>Feels very sick or very weak</li> </ul> <p>You should get emergency care right away if your child</p> <ul> <li>Has trouble breathing</li> <li>Starts drooling</li> <li>Has a lot of trouble swallowing</li> </ul> <h3>How is tonsillitis diagnosed?</h3> <p>To diagnose tonsillitis, your child's health care provider will first ask you about your child's symptoms and medical history. The provider will look at your child's throat and neck, checking for things such as redness or white spots on the tonsils and swollen lymph nodes.</p> <p>Your child will probably also have one or more tests to check for strep throat, since it can cause tonsillitis and it requires treatment. It could be a rapid strep test, a throat culture, or both. For both tests, the provider uses a cotton swab to collect a sample of fluids from your child's tonsils and the back of the throat. With the rapid strep test, testing is done in the office, and you get the results within minutes. The throat culture is done in a lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. The throat culture is a more reliable test. So sometimes if the rapid strep test is negative (meaning that it does not show any strep bacteria), the provider will also do a throat culture just to make sure that your child does not have strep.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for tonsillitis?</h3> <p>Treatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause. If the cause is a virus, there is no medicine to treat it. If the cause is a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, your child will need to take <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/antibiotics.html'>antibiotics</a>. It is important for your child to finish the antibiotics even if he or she feels better. If treatment stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect your child.</p> <p>No matter what is causing the tonsillitis, there are some things you can do to help your child feel better. Make sure that your child</p> <ul> <li>Gets a lot of rest</li> <li>Drinks plenty of fluids</li> <li>Tries eating soft foods if it hurts to swallow</li> <li>Tries eating warm liquids or cold foods like popsicles to soothe the throat</li> <li>Isn't around cigarette smoke or do anything else that could irritate the throat</li> <li>Sleeps in a room with a humidifier</li> <li>Gargles with saltwater</li> <li>Sucks on a lozenge (but do not give them to children under four; they can choke on them)</li> <li>Takes an over-the-counter <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/painrelievers.html'>pain reliever</a> such as acetaminophen. Children and teenagers should not take aspirin.</li> </ul> <p>In some cases, your child may need a tonsillectomy.</p> <h3>What is a tonsillectomy and why might my child need one?</h3> <p>A tonsillectomy is surgery to remove the tonsils. Your child might need it if he or she</p> <ul> <li>Keeps getting tonsillitis</li> <li>Has bacterial tonsillitis that does not get better with antibiotics</li> <li>Has tonsils are too big, and are causing trouble breathing or swallowing</li> </ul> <p>Your child usually gets the surgery and goes home later that day. Very young children and people who have complications may need to stay in the hospital overnight. It can take a week or two before your child completely recovers from the surgery.</p>",N,

Most people can feel much better by making lifestyle changes, learning ways to relax and taking <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/painrelievers.html'>pain relievers</a>.</p> <p>Not all headaches require a doctor's attention. But sometimes headaches warn of a more serious disorder. Let your health care provider know if you have sudden, severe headaches. Get medical help right away if you have a headache after a blow to your head, or if you have a headache along with a stiff neck, fever, confusion, loss of consciousness, or pain in the eye or ear.</p> <p >NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</p>",N,

WHY:	Psychosis may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, or with the administration of steroids, cimetadine (Tagemet), or reserpine.	HOW:	A psychosis probably exists if a patient demonstrates one or more of the following major criteria: MAJOR CRITERIA LOSS OF CONTACT WITH REALITY -- evidenced by the misinterpretation of the environment as hostile when friendly or vice versa, generally causing bizarre responses to normal and usual environmental stimuli. THOUGHT DISTURBANCE -- evidenced by incoherence, marked illogical content, marked loose associations, or patient's admission of mental confusion and abnormal rate of mental activity. PERSONALITY/BEHAVIOR CHANGES -- characterized by rapid onset and reversals of previous behavior patterns, often observed by reliable family member or friend. The diagnosis is further strengthened by the presence of one or more of the following minor criteria: MINOR CRITERIA DELUSIONS -- firmly held beliefs that cannot be dissuaded by logical discussion; generally of a threatening, powerful, or grandiose nature. ILLUSIONS -- misperceptions of environmental stimuli, e.g. perceiving a person instead of an actual tree shadow. HALLUCINATIONS -- perceptions without environmental stimuli, e.g. hearing voices/noises or seeing a face/vision.	REFS:	1) ""Differential Diagnosis of Psychotic Features"".

You have diarrhea if you have loose stools three or more times in one day. Acute diarrhea is diarrhea that lasts a short time. It is a common problem. It usually lasts about one or two days, but it may last longer. Then it goes away on its own.</p> <p>Diarrhea lasting more than a few days may be a sign of a more serious problem. Chronic diarrhea -- diarrhea that lasts at least four weeks -- can be a symptom of a chronic disease. Chronic diarrhea symptoms may be continual, or they may come and go.</p> <h3>Who gets diarrhea?</h3> <p>People of all ages can get diarrhea. On average, adults In the United States have acute diarrhea once a year. Young children have it an average of twice a year.</p> <p>People who visit developing countries are at risk for <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/travelershealth.html'>traveler's diarrhea</a>. It is caused by consuming contaminated food or water.</p> <h3>What causes diarrhea?</h3> <p>The most common causes of diarrhea include</p> <ul> <li>Bacteria from <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/foodborneillness.html'>contaminated food</a> or water</li> <li>Viruses such as the <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/flu.html'>flu</a>, <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/norovirusinfections.html'>norovirus</a>, or <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/rotavirusinfections.html'>rotavirus </a>.

An example is <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/lactoseintolerance.html'>lactose intolerance</a>.</li> <li>Diseases that affect the stomach, small intestine, or colon, such as <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/crohnsdisease.html'>Crohn's disease</a></li> <li>Problems with how the colon functions, such as <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/irritablebowelsyndrome.html'>irritable bowel syndrome</a></li> </ul> <p>Some people also get diarrhea after stomach surgery, because sometimes the surgeries can cause food to move through your digestive system more quickly.</p> <p>Sometimes no cause can be found. If your diarrhea goes away within a few days, finding the cause is usually not necessary.</p> <h3>What other symptoms might I have with diarrhea?</h3> <p>Other possible symptoms of diarrhea include</p> <ul> <li>Cramps or pain in the abdomen</li> <li>An urgent need to use the bathroom</li> <li>Loss of bowel control</li> </ul> <p>If a virus or bacteria is the cause of your diarrhea, you may also have a fever, chills, and bloody stools.</p> <p>Diarrhea can cause <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/dehydration.html'>dehydration</a>, which means that your body does not have enough fluid to work properly. Dehydration can be serious, especially for children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.</p> <h3>When should I see a doctor for diarrhea?</h3> <p>Although it is usually not harmful, diarrhea can become dangerous or signal a more serious problem. Contact your health care provider if you have</p> <ul> <li>Signs of dehydration</li> <li>Diarrhea for more than 2 days, if you are an adult. For children, contact the provider if it lasts more than 24 hours.</li> <li>Severe pain in your abdomen or rectum (for adults)</li> <li>A fever of 102 degrees or higher</li> <li>Stools containing blood or pus</li> <li>Stools that are black and tarry</li> </ul> <p>If children have diarrhea, parents or caregivers should not hesitate to call a health care provider. Diarrhea can be especially dangerous in newborns and infants.</p> <h3>How is the cause of diarrhea diagnosed?</h3> <p>To find the cause of diarrhea, your health care provider may</p> <ul> <li>Do a physical exam</li> <li>Ask about any medicines you are taking</li> <li>Test your stool or blood to look for bacteria, parasites, or other signs of disease or infection</li> <li>Ask you to stop eating certain foods to see whether your diarrhea goes away</li> </ul> <p>If you have chronic diarrhea, your health care provider may perform other tests to look for signs of disease.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for diarrhea?</h3> <p>Diarrhea is treated by replacing lost fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration. Depending on the cause of the problem, you may need medicines to stop the diarrhea or treat an infection.</p> <p>Adults with diarrhea should drink water, fruit juices, sports drinks, sodas without caffeine, and salty broths. As your symptoms improve, you can eat soft, bland food.</p> <p>Children with diarrhea should be given oral rehydration solutions to replace lost fluids and electrolytes.</p> <h3>Can diarrhea be prevented?</h3> <p>Two types of diarrhea can be prevented - rotavirus diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea. There are vaccines for rotavirus. They are given to babies in two or three doses.</p> <p>You can help prevent traveler's diarrhea by being careful about what you eat and drink when you are in developing countries:</p> <ul> <li>Use only bottled or purified water for drinking, making ice cubes, and brushing your teeth</li> <li>If you do use tap water, boil it or use iodine tablets</li> <li>Make sure that the cooked food you eat is fully cooked and served hot</li> <li>Avoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables</li> </ul> <p >NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</p>",N,

C0409974,A21145079,AT220106795,,MEDLINEPLUS,"<h3>What is lupus?</h3> <p>Lupus is an <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html'>autoimmune disease</a>. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.</p> <p>There are several kinds of lupus</p> <ul> <li>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe, and can affect many parts of the body.</li> <li>Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go away</li> <li>Subacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun</li> <li>Drug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.</li> <li>Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.</li> </ul> <h3>Who gets lupus?</h3> <p>Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in Caucasian women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.</p> <h3>What causes lupus?</h3> <p>The cause of lupus is not known.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of lupus?</h3> <p>Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones are</p> <ul> <li>Pain or swelling in joints</li> <li>Muscle pain</li> <li>Fever with no known cause</li> <li>Red rashes, most often on the face (also called the ""butterfly rash"")</li> <li>Chest pain when taking a deep breath</li> <li>Hair loss</li> <li>Pale or purple fingers or toes</li> <li>Sensitivity to the sun</li> <li>Swelling in legs or around eyes</li> <li>Mouth ulcers</li> <li>Swollen glands</li> <li>Feeling very tired</li> </ul> <p>Symptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare. Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.</p> <h3>How do I know if I have lupus?</h3> <p>There is no single test to diagnose lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:</p> <ul> <li>Medical history</li> <li>Complete exam</li> <li>Blood tests</li> <li>Skin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)</li> <li>Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for lupus?</h3> <p>There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.</p> <p>People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.</p> <p>Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.</p> <p>The goals of the treatment plan are to</p> <ul> <li>Prevent flares</li> <li>Treat flares when they occur</li> <li>Reduce organ damage and other problems</li> </ul> <p>Treatments may include drugs to</p> <ul> <li>Reduce swelling and pain</li> <li>Prevent or reduce flares</li> <li>Help the immune system</li> <li>Reduce or prevent damage to joints</li> <li>Balance the hormones</li> </ul> <p>Besides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.</p> <p>Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.</p> <h3>How can I cope with lupus?</h3> <p>It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.</p> <p>It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.</p> <p >NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</p>",N,

Hyperparathyroidism: a condition due to an increase in the secretion of the parathyroids, causing generalized osteitis fibrosa cystica, elevated serum calcium, decreased serum phosphorus, and increased excretion of both calcium and phosphorus.	WHY:	Several rheumatological disorders are associated with hyperpara- thyroidism. First, hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis (which may mimic hyperparathyroidism with renal stone formation and colic) have an increased incidence in patients with hyperparathyroidism. Second, patients with primary hyperparathyroidism show an increased incidence of chondrocalcinosis with episodes of calcium pyrophosphate crystal induced synovitis. Approximately 25% of patients with hyperparathyroidism will show radiographic evidence of calcification of articular cartilage and joint capsules. Finally, there can be a synovial and cartilaginous lesion (""osteogenic synovitis"") in patients with hyperparathyroidism which may mimic other primary rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In osteogenic synovitis there is softening and collapse of subchondral bone. Eventually the cartilage overlying this area erodes and is replaced by an irregular fibrocartilage. Eventually the articular surface of the joint is destroyed and secondary degenerative arthritis may develop.

Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. Vitamin D also has a role in your nervous, muscle, and immune systems.</p> <p>You can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin, from your diet, and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight. But too much <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/sunexposure.html'>sun exposure</a> can lead to skin aging and skin cancer, so many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources.</p> <h3>How much vitamin D do I need?</h3> <p>The amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age. The recommended amounts, in international units (IU), are</p> <ul> <li>Birth to 12 months: 400 IU</li> <li>Children 1-13 years: 600 IU</li> <li>Teens 14-18 years: 600 IU</li> <li>Adults 19-70 years: 600 IU</li> <li>Adults 71 years and older: 800 IU</li> <li>Pregnant and breastfeeding women: 600 IU</li> </ul> <p>People at high risk of vitamin D deficiency may need more. Check with your health care provider about how much you need.</p> <h3>What causes vitamin D deficiency?</h3> <p>You can become deficient in vitamin D for different reasons:</p> <ul> <li>You don't get enough vitamin D in your diet</li> <li>You don't absorb enough vitamin D from food (a <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/malabsorptionsyndromes.html'>malabsorption problem</a>)</li> <li>You don't get enough exposure to sunlight.</li> <li>Your liver or kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form in the body.</li> <li>You take medicines that interfere with your body's ability to convert or absorb vitamin D</li> </ul> <h3>Who is at risk of vitamin D deficiency?</h3> <p>Some people are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency:</p> <ul> <li>Breastfed infants, because human milk is a poor source of vitamin D. If you are <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/breastfeeding.html'>breastfeeding</a>, give your infant a supplement of 400 IU of vitamin D every day.</li> <li>Older adults, because your skin doesn't make vitamin D when exposed to sunlight as efficiently as when you were young, and your kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form.</li> <li>People with dark skin, which has less ability to produce vitamin D from the sun.</li> <li>People with disorders such as <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/crohnsdisease.html'>Crohn's disease</a> or <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/celiacdisease.html'>celiac disease</a> who don't handle fat properly, because vitamin D needs fat to be absorbed.</li> <li>People who are <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/obesity.html'>obese</a>, because their body fat binds to some vitamin D and prevents it from getting into the blood.</li> <li>People who have had <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/weightlosssurgery.html'>gastric bypass surgery</a></li> <li>People with osteoporosis</li> <li>People with <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/chronickidneydisease.html'>chronic kidney</a> or <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html'>liver disease</a>.</li> <li>People with <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/parathyroiddisorders.html'>hyperparathyroidism</a> (too much of a hormone that controls the body's calcium level)</li> <li>People with <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/sarcoidosis.html'>sarcoidosis</a>, <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/tuberculosis.html'>tuberculosis</a>, <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/histoplasmosis.html'>histoplasmosis</a>, or other granulomatous disease (disease with granulomas, collections of cells caused by chronic inflammation)</li> <li>People with some <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/lymphoma.html'>lymphomas</a>, a type of cancer.</li> <li>People who take medicines that affect vitamin D metabolism, such as cholestyramine (a cholesterol drug), anti-seizure drugs, <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html'>glucocorticoids</a>, antifungal drugs, and <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/hivaidsmedicines.html'>HIV/AIDS medicines</a>.</li> </ul> <p>Talk with your health care provider if you are at risk for vitamin D deficiency. There is a blood test which can measure how much vitamin D is in your body.</p> <h3>What problems does vitamin D deficiency cause?</h3> <p>Vitamin D deficiency can lead to a loss of <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/bonedensity.html'>bone density</a>, which can contribute to osteoporosis and <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/fractures.html'>fractures</a>.</p> <p>Severe vitamin D deficiency can also lead to other diseases. In children, it can cause <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/rickets.html'>rickets</a>. Rickets is a rare disease that causes the bones to become soft and bend. African American infants and children are at higher risk of getting rickets. In adults, severe vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia. Osteomalacia causes weak bones, bone pain, and muscle weakness.</p> <p>Researchers are studying vitamin D for its possible connections to several medical conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis. They need to do more research before they can understand the effects of vitamin D on these conditions.</p> <h3>How can I get more vitamin D?</h3> <p>There are a few foods that naturally have some vitamin D:</p> <ul> <li>Fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel</li> <li>Beef liver</li> <li>Cheese</li> <li>Mushrooms</li> <li>Egg yolks</li> </ul> <p>You can also get vitamin D from fortified foods. You can check the food labels to find out whether a food has vitamin D. Foods that often have added vitamin D include</p> <ul> <li>Milk</li> <li>Breakfast cereals</li> <li>Orange juice</li> <li>Other dairy products, such as yogurt</li> <li>Soy drinks</li> </ul> <p>Vitamin D is in many multivitamins. There are also vitamin D supplements, both in pills and a liquid for babies.</p> <p>If you have vitamin D deficiency, the treatment is with supplements. Check with your health care provider about how much you need to take, how often you need to take it, and how long you need to take it.</p> <h3>Can too much vitamin D be harmful?</h3> <p>Getting too much vitamin D (known as vitamin D toxicity) can be harmful. Signs of toxicity include nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss. Excess vitamin D can also damage the kidneys. Too much vitamin D also raises the level of calcium in your blood. High levels of blood calcium (hypercalcemia) can cause confusion, disorientation, and problems with heart rhythm.</p> <p>Most cases of vitamin D toxicity happen when someone overuses vitamin D supplements. Excessive sun exposure doesn't cause vitamin D poisoning because the body limits the amount of this vitamin it produces.</p>",N,

Lipids are fats or fat-like substances. They include oils, fatty acids, waxes, and cholesterol. If you have one of these disorders, you may not have enough enzymes to break down lipids. Or the enzymes may not work properly and your body can't convert the fats into energy. They cause a harmful amount of lipids to build up in your body.

This prevents the inward current flow of positively charged potassium (K+) ions into the cell, and induces a calcium ion (Ca2+) influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, which triggers exocytosis of insulin-containing granules. In addition, glyburide also inhibits the SUR1-regulated nonselective cation (NC) Ca-ATP channel, melastatin 4 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4; (TRPM4)), thereby preventing capillary failure and brain swelling. SUR1-TRPM4 channels are formed by co-assembly of SUR1 with TRPM4 in neurons, astrocytes, and capillary endothelium during cerebral ischemia.

It can also affect the vulva, which is the external part of a woman's genitals. Vaginitis can cause itching, pain, discharge, and odor.</p> <p>Vaginitis is common, especially in women in their reproductive years. It usually happens when there is a change in the balance of bacteria or yeast that are normally found in your vagina. There are different types of vaginitis, and they have different causes, symptoms, and treatments.</p> <h3>What are the different causes of vaginitis?</h3> <p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. It happens when there is an imbalance between the ""good"" and ""harmful"" bacteria that are normally found in a woman's vagina. Many things can change the balance of bacteria, including</p> <ul> <li>Taking antibiotics</li> <li>Douching</li> <li>Using an intrauterine device (IUD)</li> <li>Having unprotected sex with a new partner</li> <li>Having many sexual partners</li> </ul> <p><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/yeastinfections.html'>Yeast infections</a> (candidiasis) happen when too much candida grows in the vagina. Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere, including in your body. You may have too much growing in the vagina because of</p> <ul> <li>Antibiotics</li> <li>Pregnancy</li> <li>Diabetes, especially if it is not well-controlled</li> <li>Corticosteroid medicines</li> </ul> <p><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/trichomoniasis.html'>Trichomoniasis</a> can also cause vaginitis. Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease. It is caused by a parasite.</p> <p>You can also have vaginitis if you are allergic or sensitive to certain products that you use. Examples include vaginal sprays, douches, spermicides, soaps, detergents, or fabric softeners. They can cause burning, itching, and discharge.</p> <p>Hormonal changes can also cause vaginal irritation. Examples are when you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or when you have gone through menopause.</p> <p>Sometimes you can have more than one cause of vaginitis at the same time.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of vaginitis?</h3> <p>The symptoms of vaginitis depend on which type you have.</p> <p>With BV, you may not have symptoms. You could have a thin white or gray vaginal discharge. There may be an odor, such as a strong fish-like odor, especially after sex.</p> <p>Yeast infections produce a thick, white discharge from the vagina that can look like cottage cheese. The discharge can be watery and often has no smell. Yeast infections usually cause the vagina and vulva to become itchy and red.</p> <p>You may not have symptoms when you have trichomoniasis. If you do have them, they include itching, burning, and soreness of the vagina and vulva. You may have burning during urination. You could also have gray-green discharge, which may smell bad.</p> <h3>How is the cause of vaginitis diagnosed?</h3> <p>To find out the cause of your symptoms, your health care provider may</p> <ul> <li>Ask you about your health history</li> <li>Do a pelvic exam</li> <li>Look for vaginal discharge, noting its color, qualities, and any odor</li> <li>Study a sample of your vaginal fluid under a microscope</li> </ul> <p>In some cases, you may need more tests.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for vaginitis?</h3> <p>The treatment depends on which type of vaginitis you have.</p> <p>BV is treatable with <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/antibiotics.html'>antibiotics</a>. You may get pills to swallow, or cream or gel that you put in your vagina. During treatment, you should use a condom during sex or not have sex at all.</p> <p>Yeast infections are usually treated with a cream or with medicine that you put inside your vagina. You can buy over-the-counter treatments for yeast infections, but you need to be sure that you do have a yeast infection and not another type of vaginitis. See your health care provider if this is the first time you have had symptoms. Even if you have had yeast infections before, it is a good idea to call your health care provider before using an over-the-counter treatment.</p> <p>The treatment for trichomoniasis is usually a single-dose antibiotic. Both you and your partner(s) should be treated, to prevent spreading the infection to others and to keep from getting it again.</p> <p>If your vaginitis is due to an allergy or sensitivity to a product, you need to figure out which product is causing the problem. It could be a product that you started using recently. Once you figure it out, you should stop using the product.</p> <p>If the cause of your vaginitis is a hormonal change, your health care provider may give you estrogen cream to help with your symptoms.</p> <h3>Can vaginitis cause other health problems?</h3> <p>It is important to treat BV and trichomoniasis, because having either of them can increase your risk for getting <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/hivaids.html'>HIV</a> or another <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/sexuallytransmitteddiseases.html'>sexually transmitted disease</a>.
