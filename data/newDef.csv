This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.</p> <p>There are several kinds of lupus</p> <ul> <li>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe, and can affect many parts of the body.</li> <li>Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go away</li> <li>Subacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun</li> <li>Drug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.</li> <li>Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.</li> </ul> <h3>Who gets lupus?</h3> <p>Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in Caucasian women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.</p> <h3>What causes lupus?</h3> <p>The cause of lupus is not known.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of lupus?</h3> <p>Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones are</p> <ul> <li>Pain or swelling in joints</li> <li>Muscle pain</li> <li>Fever with no known cause</li> <li>Red rashes, most often on the face (also called the ""butterfly rash"")</li> <li>Chest pain when taking a deep breath</li> <li>Hair loss</li> <li>Pale or purple fingers or toes</li> <li>Sensitivity to the sun</li> <li>Swelling in legs or around eyes</li> <li>Mouth ulcers</li> <li>Swollen glands</li> <li>Feeling very tired</li> </ul> <p>Symptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare. Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.</p> <h3>How do I know if I have lupus?</h3> <p>There is no single test to diagnose lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:</p> <ul> <li>Medical history</li> <li>Complete exam</li> <li>Blood tests</li> <li>Skin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)</li> <li>Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for lupus?</h3> <p>There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.</p> <p>People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.</p> <p>Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.</p> <p>The goals of the treatment plan are to</p> <ul> <li>Prevent flares</li> <li>Treat flares when they occur</li> <li>Reduce organ damage and other problems</li> </ul> <p>Treatments may include drugs to</p> <ul> <li>Reduce swelling and pain</li> <li>Prevent or reduce flares</li> <li>Help the immune system</li> <li>Reduce or prevent damage to joints</li> <li>Balance the hormones</li> </ul> <p>Besides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.</p> <p>Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.</p> <h3>How can I cope with lupus?</h3> <p>It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.</p> <p>It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.</p> <p >NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</p>",MEDLINEPLUS,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AT230152632,A28621242,,C0040425,,"<h3>What are tonsils?</h3> <p>Tonsils are lumps of tissue at the back of the throat. There are two of them, one on each side. Along with the <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/adenoids.html'>adenoids</a>, tonsils are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. Tonsils and adenoids work by trapping the germs coming in through the mouth and nose.</p> <h3>What is tonsillitis?</h3> <p>Tonsillitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the tonsils. Sometimes along with tonsillitis, the adenoids are also swollen.</p> <h3>What causes tonsillitis?</h3> <p>The cause of tonsillitis is usually a viral infection. Bacterial infections such as <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/streptococcalinfections.html'>strep throat</a> can also cause tonsillitis.</p> <h3>Who gets tonsillitis?</h3> <p>Tonsillitis is most common in children over age two. Almost every child in the United States gets it at least once. Tonsillitis caused by bacteria is more common in kids ages 5-15. Tonsillitis caused by a virus is more common in younger children.</p> <p>Adults can get tonsillitis, but it is not very common.</p> <h3>Is tonsillitis contagious?</h3> <p>Although tonsillitis is not contagious, the viruses and bacteria that cause it are contagious. <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/germsandhygiene.html'>Frequent handwashing</a> can help prevent spreading or catching the infections.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of tonsillitis?</h3> <p>The symptoms of tonsillitis include</p> <ul> <li>A <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/sorethroat.html'>sore throat</a>, which may be severe</li> <li>Red, swollen tonsils</li> <li>Trouble swallowing</li> <li>A white or yellow coating on the tonsils</li> <li>Swollen glands in the neck</li> <li>Fever</li> <li>Bad breath</li> </ul> <h3>When should I get medical help for my child?</h3> <p>You should call your health care provider if your child</p> <ul> <li>Has a sore throat for more than two days</li> <li>Has trouble or pain when swallowing</li> <li>Feels very sick or very weak</li> </ul> <p>You should get emergency care right away if your child</p> <ul> <li>Has trouble breathing</li> <li>Starts drooling</li> <li>Has a lot of trouble swallowing</li> </ul> <h3>How is tonsillitis diagnosed?</h3> <p>To diagnose tonsillitis, your child's health care provider will first ask you about your child's symptoms and medical history. The provider will look at your child's throat and neck, checking for things such as redness or white spots on the tonsils and swollen lymph nodes.</p> <p>Your child will probably also have one or more tests to check for strep throat, since it can cause tonsillitis and it requires treatment. It could be a rapid strep test, a throat culture, or both. For both tests, the provider uses a cotton swab to collect a sample of fluids from your child's tonsils and the back of the throat. With the rapid strep test, testing is done in the office, and you get the results within minutes. The throat culture is done in a lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. The throat culture is a more reliable test. So sometimes if the rapid strep test is negative (meaning that it does not show any strep bacteria), the provider will also do a throat culture just to make sure that your child does not have strep.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for tonsillitis?</h3> <p>Treatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause. If the cause is a virus, there is no medicine to treat it. If the cause is a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, your child will need to take <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/antibiotics.html'>antibiotics</a>. It is important for your child to finish the antibiotics even if he or she feels better. If treatment stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect your child.</p> <p>No matter what is causing the tonsillitis, there are some things you can do to help your child feel better. Make sure that your child</p> <ul> <li>Gets a lot of rest</li> <li>Drinks plenty of fluids</li> <li>Tries eating soft foods if it hurts to swallow</li> <li>Tries eating warm liquids or cold foods like popsicles to soothe the throat</li> <li>Isn't around cigarette smoke or do anything else that could irritate the throat</li> <li>Sleeps in a room with a humidifier</li> <li>Gargles with saltwater</li> <li>Sucks on a lozenge (but do not give them to children under four; they can choke on them)</li> <li>Takes an over-the-counter <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/painrelievers.html'>pain reliever</a> such as acetaminophen. Children and teenagers should not take aspirin.</li> </ul> <p>In some cases, your child may need a tonsillectomy.</p> <h3>What is a tonsillectomy and why might my child need one?</h3> <p>A tonsillectomy is surgery to remove the tonsils. Your child might need it if he or she</p> <ul> <li>Keeps getting tonsillitis</li> <li>Has bacterial tonsillitis that does not get better with antibiotics</li> <li>Has tonsils are too big, and are causing trouble breathing or swallowing</li> </ul> <p>Your child usually gets the surgery and goes home later that day. Very young children and people who have complications may need to stay in the hospital overnight. It can take a week or two before your child completely recovers from the surgery.</p>",MEDLINEPLUS,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into Th2 cells, a process that is promoted by interleukin 4 (IL-4). Activated Th2 cells stimulate B cells to produce IgE antibodies in response to IL-4 and IL-13. IgE binds the high affinity IgE receptor at the surface of mast cells, the proliferation and differentiation of which is promoted by IL-9.The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Activated mast cells and Th2 cells also induce the production of IL-5. IL-5 travels to the bone marrow and regulates the differentiation and egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the blood. Moreover activated mast cells and Th2 cells in the lung generate the cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-13 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. These cytokines stimulate the generation of eotaxin by lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Eotaxin then stimulates the selective recruitment of eosinophils from the airway microvessels into the lung tissue.

Seizure: a paroxysmal transient disturbance of brain function that may be manifested as episodic impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor phenomena, psychic or sensory disturbance or perturbation of the autonomic brain electrical activity.	WHY:	Seizures may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus or in necrotizing vasculitides such as polyarteritis, eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis, aortic arch arteritis, or rheumatoid arteritis.	HOW:	A seizure probably exists when there are generalized convulsions or focal motor/sensory phenomenon. GENERALIZED CONVULSIONS may be preceded by an aura but usually have a sudden loss of consciousness with generalized muscle rigidity then generalized muscle activity. They may have incontinence of urine or feces or laceration of the tongue or buccal mucosa. This usually is followed by flaccidity, drowsiness, or complaints of a headache or sore muscles. FOCAL MOTOR/SENSORY PHENOMENON may precede generalized convulsions but may be tonic or clonic muscle activity that is limited to one extremity, one side of the body, or one side of the face or lateralized/localized sensory sensations. These may only be brief sudden involuntary muscle contractions associated with transitory loss of muscle tone and a brief loss of contact with the environment, repetitive automatic behavior patterns, feelings of familiarity or unfamiliarity associated with compulsive thinking, unpleasant epi- gastric sensations that may radiate to the head, or hallucinations of an auditory, vertiginous, olfactory, gustatory, or visual type.

Overuse can cause stress fractures, which are very small cracks in the bone.</p> <p> Symptoms of a fracture are</p> <ul> <li>Intense pain</li> <li>Deformity - the limb looks out of place</li> <li>Swelling, bruising, or tenderness around the injury</li> <li>Numbness and tingling</li> <li>Problems moving a limb</li> </ul> <p>You need to get medical care right away for any fracture. An x-ray can tell if your bone is broken. You may need to wear a cast or splint. Sometimes you need surgery to put in plates, pins or screws to keep the bone in place.</p>",MEDLINEPLUS,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AT197987470,A19027956,,C2984259,,"Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) show elevated expression of EGF receptors (e.g. HER2/neu) and their ligands (e.g. TGF-alpha) consistent with the presence of this autocrine loop. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes.
